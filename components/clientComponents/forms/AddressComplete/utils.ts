// Helper function to test if the address has multiple results.
// -- ref: Issue #4464, Issue #4417
// This helper exists because the AddressComplete API has arbitrary returning of if an Address is Nested or not.
// This is usually determined by the
//    Next: AddressCompleNext;
//    Retrieve for a regular address or Find for a Nested.
// Eg: Typing in 'King St W, Toro' may return 'Retrieve' for all the auto complete values but it provides nested Addresses.
// This regex is an attempt to correct that until the API is updated.
//
// Breakdown of the regex:
// \s+-\s+ - Matches the " - " part with optional spaces around the hyphen.
// \d+ - Matches one or more digits.
// \s+Addresses$ - Matches the word "Addresses" with a space before it, ensuring it is at the end of the string.
// i - Makes the pattern case insensitive.
