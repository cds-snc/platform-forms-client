/**
 * Adds an accessible submit button that has a spinner when loading.
 *
 * Note:
 * The difference between this and the "standard" Button is this does not disable the submit button
 * when loading. The main reason for this is that it is confusing for AT users to have a button
 * that changes suddenly to be out of the tab order (not focussable or activateable). Instead this
 * button gives a visual and AT accessible indication that it is loading. The button also
 * programmatically disables a form submit while loading just like a disabled button would.
 *
 * Here's a helpful article on the topic:
 * https://adrianroselli.com/2024/02/dont-disable-form-controls.html
 *
 * Note about above Note:
 * I think it is weird that AT do not do more with an html buttons DOM state switching to disabled
 * or with aria-disabled but this is what we have to work with.
