## Template API

The template API provides the ability to access Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on JSON template objects. All API requests are type POST.

### Authentication

Only the `GET` method can be used without authentication. The `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` methods all require a valid `next-auth.session-token` attached in the Cookie value of the request Header.

### Request Body

```json
{
  method: "GET" || "INSERT" || "UPDATE" || "DELETE",
  formID: "formID string identifier",
  formConfig: {JSON Configuration Object}
}
```

The method parameter is required. Each method has different requirements for formID and formConfig as detailed below.

- **GET method:** formID is an optional parameter. If provided, the form matching the provided ID will be returned. If no matching form is found, no records will be returned. If no formID is provided, all forms will be returned.

- **INSERT Method:** formConfig is a required parameter.

- **UPDATE method:** Both formID and formConfig are required parameters.

- **Delete method:** formID is a required parameter.

## Submission API

The Submission API provides the ability to submit form responses for a given form ID. This API does not require authentication. API requests are type POST and must be set to `Content-Type: "mulitpart/form-data"`

{
  "formID": "Form ID to search for responses",
  "action": "GET"
}
```
