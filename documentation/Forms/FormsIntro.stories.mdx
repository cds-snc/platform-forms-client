### Creating components

We use a micro-generator tool called [plop](https://plopjs.com/documentation/#your-first-plopfile) to automatically generate React components for us.

To generate a component with prompts:

```
npm run create component
```

To generate a component when you know its name and html tag:

```
npm run create component MyComponentTest div
```
