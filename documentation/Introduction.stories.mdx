# Welcome to CDS Platform Forms

> \*Note: This is work-in-progress

### Technical Documentation

- [Architecture](https://cds-snc.github.io/platform-forms-client/?path=/story/forms-docs-architecture--page)
- Tech stack: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), TypeScript, React components, using Formik for form processing
- [Data Models](https://cds-snc.github.io/platform-forms-client/?path=/story/forms-docs-form-viewer-json--page)

### Embed a form

- To embed a form via iframes, simply append the `?embed=true` parameter to the URL of the form, e.g.

```HTML
<iframe src="https://forms-formulaires.alpha.canada.ca/id/20?embed=true" title="Form description title"></iframe>
```

### Forms Design System

- The UI inventory is a single source of truth for both Design and Development when it comes to best practices in UI.
- It serves as a testing tool, where designers can compare their Figma creations with what was built, and developers can check if their apps generate the correct HTML/CSS (no matter the tech-stack used)
- There's Accessibility review via an [integrated addon](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/a11y)
- An option to preview that element in Figma via an [integrated addon](https://github.com/pocka/storybook-addon-designs)
- View code source in HTML via [storybook docs essential addon](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/introduction)
