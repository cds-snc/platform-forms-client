# Welcome to CDS Platform Storybook

> \*Note: This is work-in-progress

### Overview

This is an effort to identify the UI inventory used by CDS Platform products and showcase it in Storybook.

Some of the goals for this inventory are:

- Be a single source of truth for both Design and Development when it comes to best practices in UI.
- Serve as a testing tool, where designers can compare their Figma creations with what was built, and developers can check if their apps generate the correct HTML/CSS (no matter the tech-stack used)
- etc

### Features

In addition to having an overview of the Design System, the inventory will show:

- The generated UI element in HTML/CSS
- Preview of that element in Figma via an [integrated addon](https://github.com/pocka/storybook-addon-designs)
- Accessibility review via an [integrated addon](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/a11y)
- Code source in HTML via [storybook docs essential addon](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/introduction)
