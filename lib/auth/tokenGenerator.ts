/*
The Copyrighted code was copied and modified for brevity.
Original code :https://github.com/sindresorhus/crypto-random-string
It's insertion directly into our codebase is a mitigation strategy against the risk of the original code being modified or removed.

Entropy is calculated as log2(N^L) where N is the number of possible characters and L is the length of the string
For easy-to-read characters, N = 32, so entropy = log2(32^L) = L * log2(32) = L * 5
Length of 5 gives us 25 bits of entropy, which is enough for a token that is only used once
