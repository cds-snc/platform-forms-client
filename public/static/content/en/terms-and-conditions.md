# Terms and conditions

These terms and conditions outline the roles and responsibilities of the [Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat.html) in hosting this form.  To learn about how the department or agency that published this form manages your submission, return to the form you were viewing.    

## How we protect your privacy

When you submit a form, it is temporarily stored in a secure database managed by the [Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat.html), before being processed by the department or agency that created it. Once processed, your form submission is deleted from our database and the department or agency that created the form protects and stores your submission according to their own policies. 

The [Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat.html) does not use the personal information you provide on a form for any administrative purpose, unless it created and administers the form itself. We do not make decisions about you or your submission and take security measures, such as encrypting the information and deleting it after up to 60 days. [Section 7 of the *Financial Administration Act*](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/section-7.html), allows us to collect and store personal information.

The department or agency you’re communicating with also protects your personal information. The Privacy Notice on the form should explain how they do this.

## Providing content in Canada's official languages

The [Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat.html) enables the creation of forms in both official languages, English and French.

When there is no obligation to provide information in both official languages, content may be available in one official language only.
