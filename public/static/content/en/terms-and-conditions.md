# Terms and conditions
These terms and conditions outline the roles and responsibilities of [Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC)](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development.html) in hosting this form.  

To learn about how a department or agency manages your form submissions, return to the form you were viewing.

## How we protect your privacy

When you submit a form, it is temporarily stored in a secure database managed by Employment and Social Development Canada for up to 60 days. It is then processed and stored by the department or agency that created the form according to their own policies and processes.

[Employment and Social Development Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development.html) does not use the personal information you provide on a form for any administrative purpose, unless it created and administers the form itself. Section 5.1 of the [*Department of Employment and Social Development Act*](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/h-5.7/FullText.html), allows us to collect and store personal information.

The department or agency you’re communicating with also protects your personal information. The Privacy Notice on the form should explain how they do this.

Personal information is also collected in compliance with the [Privacy Act](https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/index.html).

### We use web analytics to help improve your experience

Web analytics show us measures such as the type of browser used to visit the website, the pages visited, and the links clicked. This information helps us learn how our website is being used to improve your experience.

This form uses a third-party service provider, Google Inc. (Google Analytics). The analytics collected do not include information that could identify you or your location, such as your IP address.

### Questions or complaints

Send questions about your personal information to the department or agency’s [Access to Information and Privacy Coordinator](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/ap/atip-aiprp/coord-eng.asp).

Send complaints about how your personal information has been handled to the [Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/):

## Our commitment to accessibility

[Employment and Social Development Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development.html) is committed to achieving a high standard of accessibility as defined in the [Standard on Web Accessibility](http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=23601) and the [Standard on Optimizing Websites and Applications for Mobile Devices](http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=27088).

## Providing content in Canada's official languages

[Employment and Social Development Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development.html) enables the creation of forms in both official languages, English and French. The [*Official Languages Act*](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/O-3.01/), the [Official Languages (Communications with and Services to the Public) Regulations](http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-92-48/index.html) and [Treasury Board policy requirements](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=26160) establish the use of both English and French to provide services to or communicate with members of the public. When there is no obligation to provide information in both official languages, content may be available in one official language only.

## Protecting the Security of Government of Canada Websites

Software programs are used to monitor network traffic and to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. When you visit an [Employment and Social Development Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development.html) website, these software programs automatically receive and temporarily store information supplied by your browser in our Web server logs for 3 months. Some of the information automatically collected by our server when you browse our website includes:
- the name of the form you completed (not your response).

- the name of the domain you used to access the Internet (.com, .org, .net, .ca, etc.).
- the type of browser you used (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, etc).

- the date and time you accessed the site.
- the pages you have accessed and the documents you have downloaded.

This is statistical data and does not directly identify you. No attempt is made to link this data, nor the IP addresses of devices that have contacted our website, with the identity of individuals visiting our site, unless an attempt to damage the site has been detected. The programs are never used to gather specific personal information such as your name, your phone number, or your email address.

When a threat to the website or computer systems of the Government of Canada is detected, information is collected pursuant to section 161 of the [*Financial Administration Act*](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/f-11/). The information may be shared with appropriate law enforcement authorities if suspected criminal activities are detected. Such information may be used for network security related statistical purposes, audit, evaluation, research, planning and reporting, and is included in [Personal Information Bank Security Incidents and Privacy Breaches (PSU 939)](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/access-information/information-about-programs-information-holdings/standard-personal-information-banks.html#psu939).
