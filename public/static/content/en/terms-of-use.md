# Terms of use

The following terms apply to the use of GC Forms, a product operated by the Canadian Digital Service (CDS) at [Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC)](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development.html). GC Forms is available for use by Canadian federal departments and agencies to create online forms.

## Accept all conditions and risks

You must be comfortable with our [privacy notice](https://articles.alpha.canada.ca/forms-formulaires/privacy-notice-statement/) and [service-level agreement](/en/sla), including the support process, application uptime, security measures, etc.

We may:

- Suspend your account if you misuse GC Forms. Misuse includes not following these terms of use or your department or agency’s policies and procedures for using software products.
- Share general use case information about GC Forms in public forums, such as blog posts, presentations, and conferences.
- Ask for service standard metrics to assess form submission quality, impacts on workflow, and rates of program admission related to introducing GC Forms into your program or service.

## Protect and process personal and sensitive information

You are responsible for:

- Having authority to collect personal information. If you are unsure about your authorities, contact your department or agency’s [Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) coordinator](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/ap/atip-aiprp/coord-eng.asp).
- Protecting the personal and sensitive information submitted in form responses. GC Forms holds and stores the information temporarily but your department or agency has ultimate custody and control.
- Drafting and publishing a privacy notice for your form following the [Directive on Privacy Practices](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=18309) Section 4.2.10. We also include [Terms and conditions](/en/terms-and-conditions) in the footer of every form to meet policy requirements related to hosting the form on your behalf. We share information about our retention and disposition of form responses in our databases as well as features to protect the security of Government of Canada websites.
- Identifying the confidentiality of the information collected through your forms. GC Forms supports the collection of data classified as up to PROTECTED B. Learn more about identifying confidentiality through the [Standard on Security Categorization](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32614).
- Complying with the [Privacy Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/p-21/) and [Access to Information Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/a-1/) related to the personal and sensitive information in responses submitted through your forms, if there is a request, incident, or data breach.
- Retrieving responses directly from our database when handling more sensitive Protected B information, either by downloading from GC Forms or via the data retrieval API. Receiving responses via email  is only possible for forms for up to Protected A published prior to June 11, 2025.
- Ensuring that other team members given access to your forms and responses have the appropriate authorities and the security clearance needed to access the data collected. For this reason, shared email accounts are not permitted in GC Forms. Any access must be given to authorized employees only using a valid Government of Canada email address.

### Responses delivered by email (up to and including Protected A)

If you had a published form prior to June 11, 2025, with this delivery method, you are responsible for:

- Managing any non-legitimate documents uploaded and submitted by end users (e.g. inappropriate or disturbing content).
- Implementing content scanning measures for submissions with file upload to reduce the possibility of viruses or malicious software (e.g. virus scanning done by departmental email services).
- Addressing service or operational impacts due to end users uploading documents to submissions for the purpose of spamming.
- Accepting [GC Notify's terms of use](https://notification.canada.ca/terms).
- Understanding that you will not be able to make updates to the form while maintaining your data delivery method as email.

### Responses downloaded from GC Forms (up to and including Protected B)

You are responsible for:

- Adhering to your departmental guidance for acceptable device and network use.
- Saving a copy and confirming receipt of your form responses within 45 days of receiving a submission.
- Reporting any problems with saved form responses.
- Handling, opening, and saving form responses in accordance with your retention and disposition schedule.

### Responses retrieved via the API (up to and including Protected B)

You are responsible for:

Ensuring the API key associated with your form is secure to protect access to form response. This includes:

- Storing the API key in a safe place on a Government of Canada machine.
- Not sharing the API key by email, support requests, or in a plain text file in a source repository as this would compromise the privacy and security of responses.
- Using encrypted email on the Government of Canada network, if there is an absolute need to transfer the private API key to authorized staff, for the purpose of setting up the API integration.
- Deleting and re-creating your form's API key, if it's suspected to have been compromised.

## Practice continuous security

- Use a valid individual government email belonging to an employee (not a shared inbox) to create your account and for two-factor authentication (2FA).
- Do not share your password with anyone or store it where others could find it. If someone else needs access to a form, [contact us](/en/support).
- Safeguard your API keys. If you suspect an API key has been compromised, notify us, and delete and re-create a new API key to secure access to form responses.
- Ensure the privacy and security of protected information upon downloading form responses from GC Forms. If Responses are not saved and confirmed within 45 days, we will take necessary steps to ensure they are retrieved by the responsible program or service.
- Report any security breach or vulnerability using the steps outlined in our [Security notice](https://digital.canada.ca/security-notice/).

## Publish in both Official Languages

You are responsible for the completeness and accuracy of translations.

## Provide multiple channels for service and program delivery

GC Forms allows you to create and publish digital forms. You must ensure that there are alternative paths to program and service delivery for accessibility.

## Contribute to a trustworthy and consistent digital experience

You are responsible for:

- Integrating your form into your department or agency’s information architecture. This means embedding the URL to your form so that people or organizations can find it.
- Maintaining working links to your form. This includes replacing all instances of the form URL when it is modified, or removing the URL when the form is closed or deleted.
- Addressing any inquiring or requests from users experiencing issues with your form, that are not a result of a system-wide issue.
- Drafting form content based on the [Canada.ca Content Style guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/canada-content-style-guide.html).
- Following the [Design Standard for the Federal Identity Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/government-communications/design-standard.html). By default your form will appear with:
  - the Government of Canada signature in the top left corner of the header.
  - the Canada wordmark in the bottom right corner of the footer.

You may replace the Government of Canada signature with your department or agency’s signature, if you have permission to use alternate branding. The use of branding without permission or misuse of branding from other departments or agencies may result in the deactivation of your form and/or account. If you are unsure about your department or agency’s signature, contact your [Federal Identity Program coordinator](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/ap/fip-pcim/coord-eng.asp).

We ask that clients not interfere with the format of JSON files, as any updates can compromise both the accessibility of the form as well as embedded design standards for the federal identity program. We will not be providing support for forms where the JSON file has been manipulated.

For questions related to these terms of use, [contact us](/en/contact).
