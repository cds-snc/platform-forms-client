## Protect and process personal and sensitive information 

You are responsible for:
- Having authority to collect personal information. If you are unsure about your authorities, contact your department or agency’s [Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) coordinator](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/ap/atip-aiprp/coord-eng.asp).

We also include [Terms and conditions](/en/terms-and-conditions) in the footer of every form to meet policy requirements related to hosting the form on your behalf.

## Provide multiple channels for service and program delivery 

GC Forms allows you to create and publish digital forms. You must ensure that there are alternative paths to program and service delivery for accessibility.

    - the Canada wordmark in the bottom right corner of the footer.
 
 You may replace the Government of Canada signature with your  department or agency’s signature. If you are unsure about your department or agency’s signature, contact your [Federal Identity Program coordinator](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/ap/fip-pcim/coord-eng.asp).
